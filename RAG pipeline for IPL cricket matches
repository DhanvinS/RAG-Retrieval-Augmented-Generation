1. **Objective**
   The notebook implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline for IPL cricket matches. The goal is to answer questions accurately by combining **retrieval of relevant documents** with **language model generation**. Unlike normal LLMs, RAG doesn’t rely solely on what the model “knows”; it uses actual data to provide grounded answers.

2. **Data Preparation**

   * The dataset contains IPL match information, which may include details like teams, scores, dates, players, venues, and match outcomes.
   * Each piece of information is treated as a **document** for retrieval.
   * Text preprocessing may involve cleaning, formatting, or splitting the data into chunks suitable for embedding.

3. **Text Embedding**

   * Each document is converted into a **vector** using an embedding model.
   * Embeddings capture semantic meaning: similar content will have vectors close to each other in high-dimensional space.
   * This allows the system to retrieve relevant information even if the query uses different words than the document.

4. **Vector Database / Indexing**

   * All document embeddings are stored in a **vector database** (e.g., ChromaDB).
   * The vector database enables **fast similarity search**, allowing the system to find relevant documents quickly when a query comes in.
   * It acts as the knowledge base for the RAG system.

5. **Query Retrieval**

   * A user query (e.g., “Who won the 2023 IPL final?”) is also embedded into a vector.
   * The system searches the vector database to find the **most similar documents** using cosine similarity or other distance metrics.
   * This ensures that the retrieved context is highly relevant to the query.

6. **Generation**

   * The retrieved documents are provided as context to a **language model** (LLM).
   * The LLM generates a response based on both the query and the retrieved data.
   * This approach reduces hallucinations and increases factual accuracy compared to asking the LLM alone.

7. **Key Features of RAG in this Notebook**

   * **Dynamic Knowledge**: New IPL matches can be added without retraining the LLM.
   * **Contextual Answers**: The system grounds its answers in real data rather than general knowledge.
   * **Efficiency**: Only relevant documents are used for generating answers, reducing computational load.
   * **Scalability**: Can handle large datasets by storing embeddings efficiently.

8. **Summary of Flow**

   1. Prepare and clean IPL match data → split into documents.
   2. Convert documents into embeddings → store in vector database.
   3. User enters a query → query is embedded.
   4. Retrieve top-k relevant documents from vector database.
   5. LLM generates an answer using retrieved documents as context.
   6. Output is a fact-based answer grounded in IPL match data.
